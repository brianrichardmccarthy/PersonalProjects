Click Project -> Properties;
Select run/debug settings, and then the current configuration on the right pane, click edit;
In the c/c++ application textbox, select search project, and then click the binary you want to execute for the current project.
On my system, the previous problem is due to incorrect default file name --- the linker generates abinary.exe but in run configuration it is "abinary".
